# Python 100 Days of Code

üêç I have temporarily paused this course in order to focus on building up my skills in SQL and Tableau. But I'll continue updating this repository when I pick the course back up. üêç

After completing the Google Data Analytics certificate in April 2022, I wanted to start learning Python. I enrolled in the [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy and jumped right in! I immediately fell in love with learning Python and haven't been able to get over what an amazing teacher Angela Yu is.

Below I have included Replit links to the projects from the lessons in the beginner section of the course. During the first lesson in the intermediate section, I installed PyCharm and have been using that to practice in and create projects, instead of Replit. I will also include code files for each lesson/day.
